Currently you are at serious risk of losing Belgium; that sucks, but if you move yourself to Holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet.

Furthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband.

In either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.

I would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.

I completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.
On my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.
My suggestion is that you open with:
F Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea
F London - North Sea 
A Liverpool - Yorkshire
This guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.

"The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal (which is two coin flips) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.  You're going to lose STP.  The question then becomes, how to we preserve Warsaw?  My recommendation is: 
A: VIE S TYR - BOH

This plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.

"Here's what I said, verbatim (it's long...hope it doesn't break the bot):

But England's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.

...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. 

I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

Well, I generally don’t like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I’ll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. 

I’m not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. 

I’d like to keep our border clear and I’d like to act as “trio wires” for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they’ll mention something to me, and if you’ll look out for me diplomatically, I’ll give you a head’s up if ever you need to worry.

"Hello Germany, nice to make your acquaintance. 

I've been thinking about this game alot, because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy. Add in that no one is likely to NMR and I believe it will be near impossible to solo. 

Normally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East. Since I'm not intending to solo in this game, however, it doesn't make sense to go after your centers. It would be much better for both of us, I believe, to agree to a pact of non aggression.

If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.

"I wish I could say ""what can I do to help you,"" but I have nothing in range.

What I am doing is sowing some seeds of doubt with Italy - floating the idea that Russia and Turkey are working together, and backhandedly noting how bad it will be for him if they are, and they wipe you out quickly.

You have a best probabilistic set of moves, but the best you can realistically hope for is maybe 1 build if you go +Greece, +Serbia, -Trieste.  Maybe.

If I were you, I'd reach out to Italy.  Suggest that he take Tunis, and instead of forcing him out of Trieste, you'll take Greece and move on.  Tell him you're going to move to Trieste because it's your best move.  It is.  Request that he move to Vienna, because that's Russia's best move (it is) and you want to prevent him from getting another build.

"Italy just told me as much too. Says they don't trust you...but your track record with me has been pretty good so I want to continue to work with you. 
...and actually, I've been seriously mulling over a backstab of England this turn and I was wondering if you would want to help. Specifically, if you think that MAO is destined for italy anyway, I'll support you into the channel. Meanwhile, I'll move a fleet into Hel and an army to Kiel to prepare to swipe denmark.
